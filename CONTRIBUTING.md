# Contributing to fuzz-fill

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

**Security vulnerabilities — do not open a public GitHub Issue.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the private reporting process.

For setup details, workflows, and CLI usage, see [README.md](README.md).

## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to report bugs or request features.

Please include:

- A clear description of the problem or requested behaviour
- Steps to reproduce (commands, scripts, or config files)
- **fuzz-fill revision** and **LLVM revision** (required):
  - fuzz-fill: commit hash or tag (for example `git rev-parse HEAD` in your fuzz-fill checkout)
  - LLVM: commit hash, tag, or PR number (for example `git rev-parse HEAD` in your `llvm-project` checkout, or the Docker image tag if you used one)
- Your environment:
  - OS and Python version
  - LLVM build setup
  - Which workflow you were running (suite gap-filling vs commit line coverage)
- Relevant logs or output files

Search existing issues before opening a new one. If your report matches an open issue, add a comment there instead of filing a duplicate.

## Pull requests

When you create a pull request, target the **`main`** branch.

1. Identify the issue you want to address (open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues) first if one does not exist).
2. Create a branch from `main`, make your changes, and run the relevant tests locally (see [Running tests](#running-tests)).
3. Target the **`main`** branch when opening the pull request.
4. Ensure all CI workflows pass. Pull requests run security scans (gitleaks, zizmor, bandit, and trivy).
5. Submit your PR and work with the reviewer or maintainer to get it approved.

Keep changes focused and update [README.md](README.md) when you change user-facing behaviour. Add or update tests under `tests/` or `integration-tests/` as appropriate. Do not commit generated artifacts, large corpora, or local build trees.

By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the terms of [LICENCE.txt](LICENCE.txt) (Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions).
